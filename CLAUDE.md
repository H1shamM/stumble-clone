# StumbleClone — Claude Code Context

A modern StumbleUpon clone (serendipitous web discovery). Migrated from Gemini CLI to
Claude Code on 2026-06-08. Build is healthy, the SaaS UI is shipped, in-app reader-first
viewing is live, and the **discovery engine has been hardened** (URL dedup, content-type
gate, session dedup, source cooldown, type-aware rendering). Sprints 5–6 are complete —
see `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

**The app is now a native Android app, and the live product is mobile-first.** The web SaaS UI is the
prototype; the real target ships via **Capacitor** (Android; iOS deferred, no Mac). The
**Content & Rendering v2** work (Sprint 7: 24-item curated library #173, render-by-type preview cards
#172) and the **Explainer Mode epic (#215)** are **fully merged** (B1–B4, F1–F4, P1, P2 — the LLM
"re-tell a article as a scene reel", Haiku 4.5, hexagonal per `docs/EXPLAINER_BUILD_PLAN.md`).

**Current focus — Reels-first mobile (epic #295), on PR #296 (NOT yet merged).** The breakthrough is
**Browse v2 (#278): a "reels of live websites" feed** — each stumble's live site renders in a native
WebView (`@teamhive/capacitor-webview-overlay`, `ui/src/components/LiveFeed.tsx`); swipe/Next through
live sites. The model (tester-confirmed): **on native there is no separate "reel mode" — mobile *is* the
full app, the live site renders inline in the content area with the header always above it** (card +
reader view is web-only). This rework — reels-default inline, swipe handle + haptics, the scroll fix,
mobile-friendly viewport/UA, the full-app-shell layout, and the menu/modal layering fix — all lives on
branch **`feat/reels-default-native`** and is held for on-device validation. **➡️ Read `docs/PROGRESS.md`
"⏯️ RESUME HERE" + the [[mobile-device-dev-setup]] memory before continuing; checkout that branch.**
Next: an immersive (hide-chrome) toggle, then the reader toggle for articles (#284), then **M4** content
safety (launch blocker). The junior bot is on #299 (action-bar polish); keep bot PRs to one issue off
current master (recurring pitfall: stale branches + mixed/deletion PRs — see #290 closed).

## Layout (monorepo)

- `app/` — Backend. Node + TypeScript + Express 5 + better-sqlite3. Hexagonal (ports & adapters).
  - `npm start` (tsx src/main.ts) → http://localhost:3000. Seeds `stumble.db` on first run.
  - `npm test` (vitest, tests live in repo-root `tests/`), `npm run lint`.
  - **Content sources** implement `ContentFetcher` (`app/src/sources/*.ts`, one `fetchStumble` method)
    and are registered in `app/src/app.ts`'s `sources` array. Adding a source = new class + that
    registration + a unit test in `tests/unit/sources/` (mock `global.fetch`).
- `ui/` — Frontend. React 19 + Vite 8 + TypeScript 6 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui (Radix).
  - `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173. `npm run build` (tsc -b && vite build).
  - `npm test` (vitest), `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` (= `tsc -b`).
- `docs/` — workflow/standards/templates/PROGRESS. `extension/` — Chrome ext. `e2e/` — Playwright.

Run both: `cd app && npm start` then `cd ui && npm run dev`.

## ⚙️ Two-agent workflow (senior = Claude/Hisham, junior = Gemini bot)

This repo is developed by **two AI agents**:
- **Senior (Claude, as `H1shamM`, this machine)** — scopes work into GitHub issues, reviews PRs,
  and is the only one who merges. Owns architecture/security/cross-cutting work.
- **Junior (`H1shamM-bot`, Gemini Flash Lite, on a separate laptop)** — picks up small
  `gemini-ready` issues, implements them on `feat/`/`fix/` branches, opens PRs. It **cannot push
  to `master` or merge** (Write-only collaborator + branch protection; proven).

Mechanics:
- `master` branch protection: PR required + CI green (`test (app)` + `test (ui)`) + 1 code-owner
  review (CODEOWNERS = `@H1shamM`). Admin bypass is ON for the owner (so the senior can admin-merge
  its *own* PRs since it can't self-approve).
- Junior tasks = GitHub issues labeled **`gemini-ready`**, assigned to `H1shamM-bot`, written with the
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/gemini-task.md` template (atomic, explicit file allowlist, acceptance
  criteria, "do not merge"). The junior's hard rules live in `GEMINI.md` (root).
- The senior reviews each bot PR against its issue's acceptance criteria; merges if it meets spec,
  else posts a precise change-request.
- **Recurring junior pitfalls to watch for on review:** branches off stale state (stacking), forgets
  the `app.ts` source registration, mixes two issues in one PR. Catch these on review.
- A senior review loop can run via the `/loop` skill (poll bot PRs, review, merge). The junior loops
  via a `while/sleep` script on its laptop (Gemini CLI has no native scheduler).

## 🧭 Discovery engine & rendering

**Selection** (`app/src/services/discoveryService.ts`, `stumble()`): weighted-random over the
category pool. Weight = `1 + user category-pref + user source-pref`, then a **source cooldown**
(#155) multiplies by `0.05` if the asset's source appeared in the last `COOLDOWN_WINDOW` (4)
history ids, floored at `0.1` (disfavored, not banned). **Session dedup** (#147): the UI
(`useStumble.ts`) tracks seen ids and sends them as `history`; the backend filters them and, when
the pool is exhausted, fetches live then falls back to the full pool (503 only on a truly empty
corpus). Pool grows **eagerly** toward `TARGET_POOL` (background top-up); `UNIQUE(url)` + an upsert
prevent duplicate rows.

**Content types & the gate** (`app/src/services/assetGate.ts`): every asset has a
`type` (`article | image | video | interactive`; nullable `type` column). `classifyAsset` tags it —
videos (`/embed/`) and known visual/interactive sources pass without article extraction; unknown
pages must extract (`extractReadable`) to be servable. This replaced the old article-only boolean
gate that flattened everything into a reading list. The cold-start pool is a **curated library**
(`bootstrap.ts` `DEFAULT_SEED_ASSETS`): 24 hand-picked items across 8 **channels** (nullable
`channel` column) — source-capped (≤2) and format-diverse (eval-session 3/4 lessons).

**Reader** (`readerService.ts` + `readerController.ts`): `GET /api/v1/reader?url=` extracts the main
article with `@mozilla/readability` (jsdom), **sanitizes** (`sanitize-html`), in-memory cached,
rejects thin/<400-char extractions; 422 when not article-like, never 500. SSRF guard in
`utils/urlGuard.ts`.

**Rendering** (`StumbleArea.tsx`, type-aware, #154): `article` → reader (`ReaderView` + `useReader`);
`video` → 16:9 player using the **direct `/embed/`** URL (#176, not `/proxy`); `image`/`interactive`
→ a **preview card** (#172) — `PreviewCard` + `usePreview` + `GET /api/v1/preview` extracts
og:image/title/description, so un-iframable sites show a real card (title + image + "Open the site"),
never a blank iframe. A **Reader/Live `ViewModeToggle`** overrides for articles; a "reader
unavailable" card shows on extraction failure. **Open lever (session 5):** sites without an
`og:image` get a bare card — a real screenshot backstop (#179) is the top conversion fix; videos
get thumbnail cards (#180).

Search (`App.tsx`) drives the main view: results show in StumbleArea, Next cycles them, Exit returns
to random. Spacebar = next; rating shows a toast.

## Build / CI health

`npm run build` ✓, lint ✓, typecheck (`tsc -b`) ✓, full test suite ✓.
- **CI runs Node 24** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to match local npm 11 — this fixed the recurring
  `npm ci` "lock out of sync" failures. If you add a dep and CI's `npm ci` complains, regenerate the
  lock fully: `rm <pkg>/package-lock.json <pkg>/node_modules && npm install`.
- **Tailwind v4** is wired via `@tailwindcss/vite` in `ui/vite.config.ts` (without it `@import
  "tailwindcss"` is inert and the app renders with zero CSS — the original "terrible UI"). The reader
  prose uses `@tailwindcss/typography` (`@plugin` in `globals.css`).
- `ui/tsconfig.app.json` has `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` (baseUrl under TS 6).

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Workflow is strict** (`docs/WORKFLOW.md`): issue → `feat/`|`fix/` branch off master → tests →
  lint/format → Conventional Commit `Closes #N` → PR (template) → CI → squash-merge → update PROGRESS.
  This applies to the senior too (issue-first; admin-merge own PRs when CI green).
- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer** in commits (portfolio repo — author is Hisham only).
- `App.tsx` keeps a redundant `data-theme` attribute effect — a test asserts it; don't remove.
  Theme actually applies via the `.dark` class (`useTheme`).
- Tests rely on: empty-state button accessible name `"Stumble"`; `iframe title="Stumbled page"`;
  ActionButtons aria-labels (`Like`/`Dislike`/`Save to favorites`). Vitest has no auto-cleanup — call
  `afterEach(cleanup)` in component tests.
- Husky + lint-staged pre-commit (eslint --fix). Prettier for formatting.
- Local helper scripts (`shot.mjs`, `walkthrough.mjs`, `diag.mjs`, `*.png`) are gitignored.
